Paul Baumstarck \\nworks in machine learning and computer vision.  Catie Chang is actually a neuroscientist \\nwho applies machine learning algorithms to try to understand the human brain. Tom Do \\nis another PhD student, works in computa tional biology and in sort of the basic \\nfundamentals of human learning. Zico Kolter is  the head TA — he\\'s head TA two years \\nin a row now — works in machine learning a nd applies them to a bunch of robots.

So I think this is a good time to be \\nlearning this stuff and learning algorithms and having a large impact on many segments \\nof science and industry.  \\nI\\'m actually curious about something. Learni ng algorithms is one of the things that \\ntouches many areas of science and industrie s, and I\\'m just kind of curious.

       " Document(page_content=\"So in this class, we've tried to convey to you a broad set of principl es and tools that will \\nbe useful for doing many, many things. And ev ery time I teach this class, I can actually \\nvery confidently say that af ter December, no matter what yo u're going to do after this \\nDecember when you've sort of completed this  class, you'll find the things you learn in \\nthis class very useful, and these things will be useful pretty much no matter what you end \\nup doing later in your life.  \\nSo I have more logistics to go over later, but let's say a few more words about machine \\nlearning. I feel that machine learning grew out of  early work in AI, early work in artificial \\nintelligence. And over the last — I wanna say last 15 or last 20 years or so, it's been viewed as a sort of growing new capability for computers. And in particular, it turns out \\nthat there are many programs or there are many applications that you can't program by \\nhand.  \\nFor example, if you want to get a computer to read handwritten characters, to read sort of \\nhandwritten digits, that actual ly turns out to be amazingly difficult to write a piece of \\nsoftware to take this input, an image of some thing that I wrote and to  figure out just what \\nit is, to translate my cursive handwriting into — to extract the characters I wrote out in \\nlonghand. And other things: One thing that my students and I do is autonomous flight. It \\nturns out to be extremely difficult to sit dow n and write a program to  fly a helicopter.  \\nBut in contrast, if you want to do things like to get software to fl y a helicopter or have \\nsoftware recognize handwritten digits, one very  successful approach is to use a learning \\nalgorithm and have a computer learn by its elf how to, say, recognize your handwriting. \\nAnd in fact, handwritten digit recognition, this is pretty much the only approach that \\nworks well. It uses applications that are hard to program by hand.  \\nLearning algorithms has also made I guess sign ificant inroads in what's sometimes called \\ndatabase mining. So, for example, with the growth of IT and computers, increasingly \\nmany hospitals are keeping around medical reco rds of what sort of patients, what \\nproblems they had, what their prognoses was,  what the outcome was. And taking all of \\nthese medical records, which started to be digitized only about maybe 15 years, applying \\nlearning algorithms to them can turn raw medi cal records into what I might loosely call \\nmedical knowledge in which we start to detect trends in medical practice and even start to \\nalter medical practice as a result of me dical knowledge that's derived by applying \\nlearning algorithms to the sorts of medical r ecords that hospitals have just been building \\nover the last 15, 20 years in an electronic format.  \\nTurns out that most of you probably use learning algorithms — I don't know — I think \\nhalf a dozen times a day or maybe a dozen  times a day or more, and often without \\nknowing it. So, for example, every time you se nd mail via the US Postal System, turns \\nout there's an algorithm that tries to automa tically read the zip code you wrote on your \\nenvelope, and that's done by a learning al gorithm. So every time you send US mail, you \\nare using a learning algorithm, perhap s without even being aware of it.  \", metadata={'source': 'd:\\\\Github\\\\LLM-Zero-to-Hundred\\\\RAG-GPT\\\\data\\\\docs_2\\\\MachineLearningLecture01.pdf', 'page': 2})]"
